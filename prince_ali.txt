<div class="section">How Prince Ali Ababwa became so rich</div>

The story started when Aladdin was in jail for stealing food in the market. There he met an ugly disturbing old man that told him that he knew a place called the cave of wonders. Come on Aladdin! You knew the old man was going to betray you. Look at his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AEkLXkDgWI">looks</a>.

So Aladdin and his monkey went with the old man to the cave and the entrance was the mouth of a giant tiger. This is the typical situation when anyone would have said something like "go f**k yourself grampa", but Aladdin went through the cave. 

Looking into the cave he discovered a magic lamp, which contained a genie with the voice of Robin Williams. This genie, who has a carpet as his only friend, were very lonely and strange, so he wanted to be friend of Aladdin and his monkey. To achieve this, he granted him three wishes. 

<div class="subsection">What the genie told Aladdin</div>

Well, Ali Baba had them forty thieves,
Scheherazade had a thousand tales.
But master you're in luck, 'cause up your sleeves
You've got a brand of magic never fails

You've got some power in your corner now!
Some heavy ammunition in your camp!
You got some punch, pizzaz, yahoo and how.
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say:

"Mr. Aladdin, sir, what will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it down?"
You ain't never had friend like me

Life is your restaurant and I'm your maitre'd
Come on whisper what it is you want;
You ain't never had friend like me!

Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service.
You're the boss, the king, the shah.
Say what you wish; it's yours, true dish.
How 'bout a little more baklava?

Have some of column A try All of column B,
I'm in the mood to help you, dude.
You ain't never had friend like me

Oh my. No no. My my my.
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof?
Well looky here.

Can your friends go abracadabra, let her rip,
And then make the sucker disappear?

So don't just sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed,
I'm here to answer all your mid-day prayers,
You've got me bona fide certified;
You've got a genie for charge d'affaires.

I've got a powerful urge to help you out,
So what you wish, I really wanna know?
You've got a list that's three miles long, no doubt,
Well all you've gotta do is rub like so, and oh Â­-

Mr. Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three.
I'm on the job you big nabob!
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend like me.
You ain't never had a friend like me

<div class="section"> Conclusions</div>
<p>After the song, Aladdin allow the genie to be his friend in exchange of turning him into Prince Ali Ababwa. </p>
